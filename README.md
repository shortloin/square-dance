well, the goal today was to make a square move around. i guess one diagonal line isn't so much a dance, but it's a start. 

i'm learning more about how animations work, but i feel like i'm at a funny point in learning where i can understand things when i read them -- but stringing solutions together myself still feels very LOL OK. 

i ended up taking a solution from w3schools, and spending a long time trying to understand how the js works, which was cool. 

today was brought to you by a weird amount of coffee, unending self-affirmations that it's ok for learning to be hard, and several cookies.
